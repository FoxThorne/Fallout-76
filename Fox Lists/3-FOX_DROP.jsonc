//FOX_DROP includes all the items we wish to drop when overnecumbered, or otherwise just looking to clean a cluttered inventory in Fallout 76.
//DROP LIST is highly customized, utilizing lists of ALL known useless items that just clutter inventory, or aren't worth their weight.
//Included full list from HOLOTAPES (except the games) and NOTES, if there is a specific Holotape/Note you like and wish you keep be sure to comment it out.
//Feel free to add whatever else you wish, customize it to your hearts desire.
//This list is meant to be used as the INCLUSIVE list of things to drop/sell/destroy because they have little value.
//BE SURE TO ACTUALLY READ THIS LIST OR DOUBLE-CHECL YOUR LOOT BAG WHEN DROPPING ITEMS!!!
//I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DROP SOMETHING YOU WANTED!!!

//Useless Random Shit

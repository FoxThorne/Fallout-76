The new rules now require xTranslator 1.4.5+ https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/313 
update required, you will get weird results if you use an outdated version of the tool)

============================================
How to Use: 
-Start xTranslator
-If it's the first time you launch xTranslator, the options window open itself automatically.
-Check if the game path is correctly set there, otherwise manually set it in the data field. (The cache information should be in green)
-Close the option window
-Open menu -> Wizards -> Header Wizards
-Follow the instructions.
-Done!

============================================

If you want to patch the game file directly in xTranslator (one click operation):
-Copy the Interface folder in the fallout76\data\ folder  
This should look like this fallout76\data\interface\, and the files font_en.swf etc... files directly in there with no other subfolder)
in the xTranslator header wizard:
-you can create a backup of the relevant Ba2 (do this one time only after each game release)
-You can restore the backup directly (if something goes wrong)
-and finally, you can patch the game file in One Click (assuming you correctly put the relevant files in the interface folder as mentionned above)
